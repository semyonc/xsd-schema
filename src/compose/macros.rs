//! The two macros: [`xpath!`](crate::xpath!) and [`form!`](crate::form!).
//!
//! Everything in this module is `macro_rules!`, and every expansion goes
//! through `$crate::compose::…` paths, so the macros need nothing that a host
//! crate cannot reach itself.
//!
//! # Importing them
//!
//! Both macros live at the crate root:
//!
//! ```
//! use xsd_schema::{form, xpath};
//! ```
//!
//! That is the canonical import, and the one every example here uses. The
//! macros are *not* re-exported from `compose`: `compose::form` is already the
//! module holding [`Form`](crate::compose::Form), and `xsd_schema::xpath` is
//! already the XPath engine's module, so re-exporting the macros there would
//! put two different things behind one path for no gain. Names in the macro
//! namespace and names in the type namespace never collide, which is why
//! `use xsd_schema::xpath;` brings in both the module and the macro and both
//! keep working.
//!
//! # What they expand to
//!
//! [`xpath!`](crate::xpath!) is one call to the composer's cached evaluator:
//! the expression text and the variable names are `'static` literals, so a
//! call site inside a loop compiles its expression once and then only
//! evaluates.
//!
//! [`form!`](crate::form!) is a token-tree muncher over the form grammar; it
//! builds an owned [`Form`](crate::compose::Form) eagerly, evaluating every
//! escape exactly once, left to right, as the form is constructed. No closure
//! and no iterator survives into the form, which is why a `?` inside an
//! escape returns from the enclosing function and why the finished form can
//! be stored, returned and spliced later.
//!
//! # Expansion depth
//!
//! Both the nesting depth of a form and the number of items in one form cost
//! macro expansion steps, which `recursion_limit` (128 by default) bounds. A
//! form nested more than about thirty levels deep, or one with more than about
//! a hundred items, needs `#![recursion_limit = "256"]` in the consuming
//! crate. Neither is close for the compositions this layer is built for.

/// Evaluates an XPath expression on a [`Composer`](crate::compose::Composer).
///
/// ```text
/// xpath!(c, "expr")                             // no context item, no variables
/// xpath!(c, "expr", node)                       // a context item
/// xpath!(c, "expr", i = &item, b = &bids)       // the external variables $i and $b
/// xpath!(c, "expr", items, i = &item)           // a context item, then variables
/// ```
///
/// The result is `Result<`[`Value`](crate::compose::Value)`,
/// `[`ComposeError`](crate::compose::ComposeError)`>`, so a call site ends in
/// `?` and then asks the value for what it wants — `nodes`, `atomics`,
/// `boolean`, `string`, `number`, `key`.
///
/// # The argument order, and why it is a rule
///
/// The expression is always a string literal. A context item, when there is
/// one, is always the **third** argument, directly after it; everything after
/// that is a `name = value` binding, and an optional trailing comma is
/// accepted everywhere.
///
/// `name = value` is also Rust's assignment expression, so the bindings-only
/// shape is matched *before* the context shape: `xpath!(c, "$node", node =
/// value)` binds `$node` and leaves the context item empty. A named binding
/// never implies a context item, and `xpath!(c, "expr", node)` never binds
/// anything. A context item after a binding, or two of them, is a compile
/// error naming the expected order; for preparatory work, use a block that
/// ends in the node — `xpath!(c, "expr", { prepare(); doc.root() })`.
///
/// # What may be a context item
///
/// [`Nav`](crate::compose::Nav), `&Nav`, [`Doc`](crate::compose::Doc) or
/// `&Doc` — anything [`IntoContextNode`](crate::compose::IntoContextNode)
/// accepts. A document supplies its document node, a borrowed navigator is
/// cloned. Binding values are anything
/// [`IntoXPathValue`](crate::compose::IntoXPathValue) accepts, which is every
/// atomic Rust scalar, every XDM value, a node, a document, a sequence, and
/// `Option` of any of those. Variable names are Rust identifiers; a prefixed
/// external variable needs
/// [`Composer::eval`](crate::compose::Composer::eval) directly.
///
/// # Evaluation
///
/// Each supplied expression is evaluated exactly once, in the order written:
/// the composer, then the context item, then the binding values from left to
/// right. Every one of them appears exactly once in the expansion, with the
/// composer and the context item held in temporaries of the macro's own, so
/// no conversion can repeat an evaluation or reorder a side effect.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// All four call forms:
///
/// ```
/// use bumpalo::Bump;
/// use xsd_schema::compose::{ComposeError, Composer};
/// use xsd_schema::namespace::NameTable;
/// use xsd_schema::xpath;

/// | `..^{ e }` | an `IntoIterator` of those, spliced in order; an empty iterator adds nothing |
/// | `..?^{ e }` | an `IntoIterator<Item = Result<T, ComposeError>>`; the first failure returns from the enclosing function |

/// # Names
///
/// Prefixes are resolved when the document is built — against the form's own

/// [`with_namespace`](crate::compose::Composer::with_namespace) table.
/// An unprefixed element name takes the default element namespace; an
/// unprefixed attribute is in no namespace. `xml` is always bound.
///
/// **A prefixed name is written with `::`** — `(p::title …)`, `:xml::lang
/// "en"`. Rust's tokens carry no whitespace, so `(p:title "One")` and
/// `(book :id "b1")` are the same shape, and the attribute reading wins: a
/// `:` item is an attribute whenever what follows it can be an attribute
/// value. The single-colon name spelling of the design grammar is still
/// accepted where nothing attribute-shaped follows it — `(p:root (child))`,
/// `(p:root ..^{ rows })`, `(p:root)` — but `(p:title "One")` builds
/// `<p title="One"/>`. Write `(p::title "One")`, or the name as a string
/// literal `("p:title" "One")`, which is also how a name that is not a Rust
/// identifier is written: `("bid-count" "7")`.
///
/// A literal name that is not an `NCName` or `prefix:NCName` is
/// [`ComposeError::InvalidName`](crate::compose::ComposeError::InvalidName)
/// at build time, and a prefix nothing binds is
/// [`ComposeError::UnboundPrefix`](crate::compose::ComposeError::UnboundPrefix).
///
/// # Order
///
/// Attributes and declarations belong before content. The macro does not
/// enforce that — a [`Form`](crate::compose::Form) keeps its attributes and
/// its content apart — but the emitter does enforce it for a *spliced*
/// attribute node, which is
/// [`ComposeError::Copy`](crate::compose::ComposeError::Copy) when content has
/// already been written.
///
/// Items and escapes are processed left to right, each Rust expression
/// evaluated exactly once, as the form is built.
///
/// # Expansion depth
///
/// The macro is a token-tree muncher, so both the nesting depth of a form and
/// the number of items in one form cost macro expansion steps, which
/// `recursion_limit` (128 by default) bounds. A form nested more than about
/// thirty levels deep, or one carrying more than about a hundred items, needs
/// `#![recursion_limit = "256"]` in the crate that writes it. The compositions
/// this layer is built for are nowhere near either bound.
