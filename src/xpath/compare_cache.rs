//! Reuse of a general-comparison index across evaluations of one comparison.
//!
//! [`general_compare`](crate::xpath::general_compare) answers one `A = B` in
//! `O(|A| + |B|)` instead of `O(|A| · |B|)`, but it rebuilds its index every time
//! the comparison is evaluated. That is not enough for the shape
//!
//! ```text
//!     $big[not(. = $c)]
//! ```
//!
//! where **one** compiled expression is evaluated **once** but its predicate
//! evaluates the **same** comparison node up to millions of times: each
//! evaluation compares a small varying operand (the context item) against an
//! operand that does not change at all (`$c`). Each evaluation is linear in `$c`,
//! so the filter as a whole is quadratic.
//!
//! This module keeps the index of the operand that does not change for the
//! duration of one **run**, so that each later evaluation of that comparison node
//! is a hash probe plus the same confirmation by the real `eq`.
//!
//! # Where the cache lives, and how long
//!
//! In [`DynamicContext`], which is created by
//! [`XPathEvaluator::run`](crate::xpath::XPathEvaluator::run) and dropped when
//! that run returns: one cache per run, never in the compiled expression (which
//! is shared and immutable) and never global. Entries are keyed by the identity
//! of the comparison's AST node — its arena address and its node id, so that a
//! nested evaluation over a different arena can never collide with them.
//!
//! # When an operand counts as invariant
//!
//! Statically, and conservatively:
//! [`deps::run_invariant_vars`](crate::xpath::deps::run_invariant_vars) accepts an
//! operand subtree only when it reads no part of the focus it is entered with,
//! calls no function at all, and references no variable bound by a `for`, `some`
//! or `every` anywhere in the expression. What is left is a pure function of
//! state that cannot change while the expression runs: variables bound before the
//! run, literals, ranges, sequence constructors, arithmetic, `if`, and paths and
//! predicates rooted in any of those.
//!
//! Because such an operand cannot raise an error it did not raise on the first
//! evaluation, and cannot have effects, **not evaluating it** on later
//! evaluations is invisible — which is what makes the saving possible at all: for
//! `$c` the evaluation alone would clone a sequence of 100,000 items.
//!
//! On top of the static rule, every probe re-checks a cheap identity of what the
//! index was built from: for each variable slot the operand reads, the number of
//! times that slot has been written ([`VarStore::generation`](crate::xpath::VarStore),
//! bumped by every write, and the store hands out no mutable reference to a value)
//! together with the address and length of its backing storage. If either
//! differs the index is thrown away and rebuilt on the next evaluation, so a
//! rebinding this analysis did not expect costs speed rather than correctness.
//!
//! # The other operand can write while this one is being read
//!
//! The static rule constrains only the operand that is indexed. The *other* one
//! is unconstrained, and a function call in it reaches a host
//! [`FunctionEvaluator`](crate::xpath::functions::FunctionEvaluator) with
//! `&mut DynamicContext`, which can rebind any variable — including one the
//! invariant operand reads. Both operands are evaluated before an index is
//! installed, so a fingerprint taken at the end would describe a *newer* binding
//! than the value in hand, and later probes would answer from a value the
//! expression can no longer produce. Two rules keep that from happening:
//!
//! * the fingerprint of an operand is taken **at the instant that operand is
//!   evaluated**, and an index is installed only if the fingerprint still holds
//!   once the other operand has run as well;
//! * a probe checks the fingerprint **before either operand is evaluated**, so a
//!   stale index sends the whole comparison back to the untouched path with its
//!   operands evaluated in source order — left first, then right, exactly as
//!   without the cache, so effects and errors happen in the order the expression
//!   asks for.
//!
//! When the varying operand *does* write such a variable while it runs, where
//! the invariant operand sits decides what that means. On the **left** it is
//! evaluated before the varying operand, so the value the index holds is the one
//! this comparison must use and only later evaluations rebuild. On the **right**
//! it is evaluated after, so the value it would now produce is the rebound one
//! and the index must not answer.
//!
//! # Laziness
//!
//! Nothing is built on the first evaluation of a comparison node: it runs the
//! code of the previous wave, byte for byte. The index is built while the second
//! evaluation runs, and only when the invariant operand has at least
//! [`MIN_INVARIANT_ITEMS`] atomized items — below that the bounded pairwise
//! prefix in `operators` already answers the comparison at a cost no index can
//! beat. A comparison evaluated once, or with two small operands, therefore costs
//! what it cost before.
//!
//! # Why the answers stay identical
//!
//! The index answers a comparison only when it can prove both the answer *and*
//! the absence of a hard error, by the same three phases
//! [`general_compare`](crate::xpath::general_compare) documents: every key the
//! product needs is computed with the conversion the comparison itself performs,
//! every candidate pair is confirmed by the real `eq`, and a deferred type error
//! is raised by the very pair the pairwise loop would have raised it for.
//! Anything else — an unmodelled class pair, a failing conversion, an atomization
//! error, a `confirm` that unexpectedly raises — makes it decline, and the
//! declining path evaluates the operand it stood for and runs the untouched
//! comparison. XPath 1.0 compatibility mode never reaches this module.
